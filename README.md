# 2098-902 Data Science & Analytics Repository

Notebook contains 53 cells, compiles in 7 seconds



## Instructions for install:

### Requisite software:

- Command-line git or software able to access GitHub repositories
- Python version 3.# with pip installed
- JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or similar software thats able to run Python notebooks (file extension `.ipynb`)
  - These instructions are operating under the assumption that JupyterLab is installed
- The full list of requisite Python packages are included in `requirements.txt`

### Accessing the repository

- Run `git clone https://github.com/LWGames423/Data-Science-2023-2024.git` in the command line
  - The way to clone repositories may vary depending on which software you're using, check the instructions on how to clone for the software you're using
- Access the directory the repository was cloned to with the command `cd Data-Science-2023-2024` or by navigating to the folder in file explorer

### Installing requisite Python packages

- Check Python and Pip are installed with the commands `python --version` && `pip --version`
  - If the command `python` is not found, try running the command again as `python3 --version`
- Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the notebook

- Ensure JupyterLab is installed by running `jupyter --version`
  - If JupyterLab isn't installed, run `pip install JupyterLab`
- Open the notebook by running `jupyter lab Analysis.ipynb`
- Run the notebook by selecting 'Run' in the top bar, and then selecting 'Run All Cells'



## References:

- The datasets for global average temperature was collected from Berkley Earth, the carbon dioxide composition data was collected from University of California San Diego's Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and the storm data was collected from NOAA. 
- JupyterLab version 4.0.10 environment was used with Python version 3.10.12 and pip version 22.0.2
- The dataset cleaning and management was done using Pandas, statistical analyses were run with the Statsmodel or Scipy package, and the visualizations were done using Plotly.io and the ggplot2 theme.
